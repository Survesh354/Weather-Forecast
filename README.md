🌤️ Weather-Forecast Website
This is a clean, simple, and responsive Weather Forecast Website designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information for any city they search for. The interface is built entirely using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, focusing on a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

✨ Features
Clean & Intuitive UI: A modern, minimalistic design that prioritizes readability and ease of use.

Responsive Design: Fully adapts to various screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones) using CSS media queries. * Dynamic Weather Icons: Uses custom-styled CSS elements or font icons to visually represent different weather conditions (e.g., sun, clouds, rain, snow).

Basic Structure: Includes dedicated sections for the main temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.

Simple Search Bar: A prominent input field built with HTML/CSS for users to enter their desired location. (Note: While the core functionality for fetching data requires JavaScript/API, the visual component is complete.)

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Used to build the semantic structure and content layout of the website.

CSS3: Utilized for styling, including flexbox/grid for layout, custom fonts, color schemes, and basic animations/transitions.

🎨 Design & Layout
The design is focused on a dark/light color scheme for better visibility and a modern aesthetic. Key CSS techniques used include:

CSS Variables: For maintaining a consistent and easily modifiable color palette.

Flexbox: For creating the primary layout and aligning elements within the weather card.
